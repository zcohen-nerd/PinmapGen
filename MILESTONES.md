# üöÄ PinmapGen Milestones & Roadmap

This document tracks the staged development of **PinmapGen**, from a simple CLI to a polished Fusion add-in with rich validation, docs, and community workflows. Each milestone can be broken down into GitHub issues or Copilot tasks.

---

## üìç Milestone 1: Core CLI MVP ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Goal:** Standalone Python script that converts Fusion/EAGLE exports into pinmap artifacts.

**Status:** Complete. The CLI path from CAD exports to firmware artifacts is stable and covered by unit tests.

- [x] Implement CSV parser (`bom_csv.py`)
- [x] Implement EAGLE .sch XML parser (`eagle_sch.py`)
- [x] Normalize RP2040 pin names (`normalize.py`)
- [x] Detect differential pairs (DP/DM, _P/_N, CANH/CANL)
- [x] Conflict validation (duplicate pin use, lonely diff pairs)
- [x] Emit:
  - [x] `pinmap.json`
  - [x] `pinmap_micropython.py`
  - [x] `pinmap_arduino.h`
  - [x] `PINOUT.md`
  - [x] (optional) `pinout.mmd`
- [x] Add sample netlist CSV for smoke testing
- [x] VS Code tasks.json for "Generate" and "Watch"

---

## üìç Milestone 2: Better Outputs ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Goal:** Richer, role-aware generated code and docs.

- [x] Add `roles.py` to infer roles (i2c.sda, uart.tx, pwm, etc.)
- [x] Include role metadata in JSON and Markdown
- [x] MicroPython emitter: helpers for `adc()`, `pin_in()`, `pin_out()`
- [x] Arduino emitter: `DiffPair` struct for USB/CAN
- [x] Markdown: split tables into Single-ended vs Differential pairs
- [x] Mermaid: visualize diff pairs distinctly
- [x] Deterministic ordering + "Auto-generated" headers in all files

**Status:** Complete. Markdown and Mermaid outputs now surface differential information clearly and include metadata for downstream tooling.

---

## üìç Milestone 3: Developer Experience ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Goal:** Smooth workflow in VS Code and GitHub.

- [x] VS Code snippets (I2C, UART, PWM, USB setup examples)
- [x] Add `.vscode/extensions.json` recommendations
- [x] Add `.vscode/pinmap.code-snippets` for MicroPython & Arduino
- [x] Add pre-commit hook: regen pinmaps before commit

  - [x] Run generator on sample netlist
  - [x] Fail build if outputs not up to date
- [x] Add CONTRIBUTING.md with coding style, adding MCU profiles, etc.
- [x] Add basic unit tests for parsers + emitters

**Status:** Complete. Hooks, CI, tasks, and tests keep generated artifacts synchronized across contributors.

- [x] Generate CSV with correct headers: `RefDes`, `Pin`, `Component`, `Net`

**Breakthrough Results:**
- [x] **Complete automation:** Schematic ‚Üí firmware files in one click
- [x] **No manual export needed:** ULP generates netlist automatically
- [x] **All formats generated:** MicroPython, Arduino, JSON, Markdown, Mermaid
- [x] **Production ready:** Clean integration with existing PinmapGen CLI
- [x] **Proven at scale:** Successfully processed real schematic with 17 nets, multiple MCUs, power rails

**Files Generated Automatically:**
- `firmware/micropython/pinmap_micropython.py` - Ready for Raspberry Pi Pico
